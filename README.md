This is a new experience for this guy. 
I want to track the different parts of the project and just had this idea to add best hubris statements from lottery winners to it.
that is issued with old report. New feature will not have this in report but in pop-up.
Doing a restart of sorts. Caputuring the hubris of new lottery winners is still the goal. I like the idea of a database with different lotteries and attaching the hubris statements to the original lottery win, dates and game and all
